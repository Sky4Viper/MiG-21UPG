# MiG-21UPG
Aircraft for Flightgear (also known as MiG-21-93 and MiG-21Bison) upgraded version of MiG-21bis used by IAF
There isn't much information about it, therefore a lot of aspects are highly speculative. Anyway I think it is an interesting aicraft that desrves some attention.
Original MiG-21bis I decided to use as base was released by pjedvaj http://fguk.eu/index.php/hangar/download/7-military-jets/101-mikoyan-gurevich-mig-21bis
